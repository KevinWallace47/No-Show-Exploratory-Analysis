# No-Show-Exploratory-Analysis
This is an exploratory analysis of a Brazilian medical dataset. This dataset contains over 100,000 appointments and contains information such as the medical condition of the patient, weather they recieved an SMS message for their appointment, age, location, and weather they showed for their appointment or not. The main goal of this analysis is to determine what affects the no show rate of appointments and to determine what factors can affect weather a patient returns for another appointment. I have concluded that different factors such as alcoholism, SMS notification recieved, and number of sicknesses have an influence on weather or not a person shows for their appointment. I have also concluded that multiple factors affect weather a patinet returns for their appointment, such as number of sicknesses, and SMS notification recieved.
